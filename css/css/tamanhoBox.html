CSS Box Sizing

The CSS property defines how to calculate the width and height of an element: 
    should the calculation include padding and borders, or not.box-sizing

By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

    width + padding + border = actual width of an element
    height + padding + border = actual height of an element

This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears 
bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the 
element's specified width/height).

The following illustrates two <div> elements with the same specified width and height. 
The two <div> elements end up with different sizes (because div2 has a large padding specified):

This div is has width: 300px and height: 100px.

This div also has width: 300px and height: 100px.

Example

.div1 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.div2 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 50px;
  border: 1px solid red;
}

The property solves this problem.box-sizing

The CSS box-sizing Solution

The property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total 
width and height.box-sizing

If you set on an element, the padding and border are included in the calculation 
of the width and height:box-sizing: border-box;

Both divs are the same size now!

    Hooray!


Here is the same example as above, with added to both <div> elements:box-sizing: border-box;

Example
.div1 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.div2 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 50px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

Since the result of using the is so much better, many developers want all elements 
on their pages to work this way.box-sizing: border-box;

The code below ensures that all elements are sized in this more intuitive way. 
Many browsers already use for many form elements (but not all - which is why inputs 
and text areas look different at width: 100%;). box-sizing: border-box;

Applying this to all elements is safe and wise:

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
